# Plex-Discord-RPC

Use Discord RPC to display local Plex session data.


## Background
I made this for me; it is really only handling my single use case
(Linux environment and a Plex server on local network).

By all means, if someone wants to make this more generic I think they easily could.
But, that's not in the scope for this little side project.

**The only goal is to watch a show on Plex and have it update my Discord activity.**


## Approach
I just wanted to do something pretty straightforward, so here it is.

Hit Plex Web API for list of active sessions on server
Grab local IP and compare to session IP
Gather session data for current media
Update Discord activity/status via Discord RPC with media data
Provide link to Anilist entry if session is watching entry from library 'Anime'



Setup
* `` npm install```
* rename **config/secrets_template.js** to **config/secrets.js** and configure 


## Run on Startup - Linux Setup with PM2
* ```sudo npm install pm2@latest -g```
* ```pm2 start src/plex_discord_rpc.js```
* ```pm2 startup systemd``` -> run generated command
* ```pm2 save```
* ```sudo systemctl start <service>```


## Run on Startup - Lazy Windows Setup
* There are way better methods to do this, but I'm feeling particularly lazy today; I barely get on Windows anymore.
* Edit **setup/Plex_Discord_RPC.bat** to match current path of repository
* Create shortcut pointing to **setup/Plex_Discord_RPC.bat**
* Copy shortcut to ```%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup```
* If the script fails its not going to start back up. That's another problem for another day.
